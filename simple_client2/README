If you are using MSY2 on Windows use the MSYS_build32.sh or MSYS_build64.sh file to build the project.

Alternativly, you can manually start a MS VisualStudio Developer Prompt and run the build32.bat or build64.bat

The build.bat scripts will also tell you how to execute the client.dll.

This is the first client which actually does something useful. It prints out all loaded modules (DLLs) at runtime.
