If you are using MSY2 on Windows use the MSYS_build32.sh or MSYS_build64.sh file to build the project.

Alternativly, you can manually start a MS VisualStudio Developer Prompt and run the build32.bat or build64.bat

The build.bat scripts will also tell you how to execute the client.dll.

This is the most simple DynamoRio client example, it is only good for getting started witht he build chain and
basic concepts. Be aware that we kept the CMakeLists.txt as simple as possible too, for that reason, the 32/64 bit 
build.bat files are overwriting the former build version of the build\Release\simple_client.dll.
