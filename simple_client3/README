client3 - Simple DynamoRio client which prints out loaded DLLs and
          disassembles all instructions in a certain range at runtime

          Use this client only with the x64 anti-x test target app, it is
          changing the return value of the function always_return_true()
          at 0x140001190 in anti-x. It will not work on a 32bit version. 
          We keep the 32bit version as homework for you. 
          Check the output for "[ANTI-X] This value is always true: false"
          to see it is working. 

          This shows how to use drwrap to manipulate the target apps
          code at runtime, plus a few other things. Check out the 
          source code. :)
